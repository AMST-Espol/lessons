# Principles of navigation

Navigation between different screens and apps is a core part of the user experience. The following principles set a baseline for a consistent and intuitive user experience across apps. The Navigation component is designed to implement these principles by default, ensuring that users can apply the same heuristics and patterns in navigation as they move between apps.


## Fixed start destination

Every app you build has a fixed start destination. This is the first screen the user sees when they launch your app from the launcher. This destination is also the last screen the user sees when they return to the launcher after pressing the Back button. Let’s take a look at the [Sunflower app](https://github.com/android/sunflower/tree/main/app) as an example.

When launching the Sunflower app from the launcher, the first screen that a user sees is the **List Screen**, the list of plants in their garden. This is also the last screen they see before exiting the app. If they press the Back button from the list screen, they navigate back to the launcher.

##  Navigation state is represented as a stack of destinations

When your app is first launched, a  **new task**  is created for the user, and app displays its start destination. This becomes the base destination of what is known as the  _back stack_  and is the basis for your app’s navigation state. The top of the stack is the current screen, and the previous destinations in the stack represent the history of where you've been. The back stack always has the start destination of the app at the bottom of the stack.

Operations that change the back stack always operate on the top of the stack, either by pushing a new destination onto the top of the stack or popping the top-most destination off the stack. Navigating to a destination pushes that destination on top of the stack.

The  Navigation component  manages all of your back stack ordering for you, though you can also choose to manage the back stack yourself.

##  What is a task?
A  _task_  is a collection of activities that users interact with when trying to do something in your app. These activities are arranged in a stack called the  _back stack_  in the order in which each activity is opened.

For example, an email app might have one activity to show a list of new messages. When the user selects a message, a new activity opens to view that message. This new activity is added to the back stack. Then, when the user taps or gestures Back, that new activity finishes and is popped off the stack.

## Up and Back are identical within your app's task

The Back button appears in the system navigation bar at the bottom of the screen and is used to navigate in reverse-chronological order through the history of screens the user has recently worked with. When you press the Back button, the current destination is popped off the top of the back stack, and you then navigate to the previous destination.

The Up button appears in the  app bar  at the top of the screen. Within your app's task, the Up and Back buttons behave identically.
