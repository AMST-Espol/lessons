# Navigation components
Navigation refers to the interactions that let users navigate across, into, and back out from the different pieces of content within your app.


## Key concepts

 - **Host**: A UI element that contains the current navigation destination. That is, when a user navigates through an app, the app essentially swaps destinations in and out of the navigation host.
 - **Graph**: A data structure that defines all the navigation destinations within the app and how they connect together.
 - **Controller**: The central coordinator for managing navigation between destinations. The controller offers methods for navigating between destinations, handling deep links, managing the back stack, and more.
 - **Destination**: A node in the navigation graph. When the user navigates to this node, the host displays its content.


## Create a navigation controller
The navigation controller is one of the  key concepts in navigation. It holds the navigation graph and exposes methods that allow your app to move between the destinations in the graph.

For information on how to add a navigation graph to your  `NavController`, see  [Design your navigation graph](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/design).  `NavController`  provides a few different ways to navigate to the destinations in its graph.
